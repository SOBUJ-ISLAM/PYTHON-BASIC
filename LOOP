            # LOOPS
# FOR LOOPS
#  In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and execute a code block multiple times. The for loop iterates over each element in the sequence and performs the specified actions on each element.

name = 'Sobuj Islam'
for a in name:
  print(a)
  if (a=="j"):
   print ("start the last name")

# Another example of for loop

cricketers= ('shakib','mushfiq','tamim','mashrafee')
for cricketer in cricketers:
  print (cricketer)
  for i in cricketer:
    print(i)

# range() function
for a in range(6):
 print (a)

for a in range(6):
   print (a+1)

for a in range(1,10):
 print (a+1)

for a in range(1,200001):
 print (a)
  
#  In any range of for loop for range(start, stop, step) where step is optional. It means it will print the number from start to stop with the help of step.

for a in range(0,11,2):
 print (a)


       # WHILE LOOPS
# It means that it will execute the statement until the condition is true.



b = 0
while (b<5):
  print (b)
  b = b+1
print ("done with the loop")

# for a particular number

b = int(input("Enter the number: "))
while (b<=50):
  print (b)
  b=b+1
print ("done with the loop")


# for reverse order
count =int (input("enter the number"))
while (count>0):
  print (count)
  count = count-1
 

#  WHILE LOOP WITH ELSE
# It means that it will execute the statement until the condition is true.
count =int (input("enter the number"))
while (count>0):
  print (count)
  count = count-1
else:
 print("done with the loop")
